# Hi-Ring: Executive Summary

**Next-Generation Recruitment Platform | ATS + CRM**

---

## The Opportunity

The global recruitment software market is valued at **$3.2 billion** and growing at 7.4% annually. Yet, existing solutions are either:
- **Too expensive** (Greenhouse: $6,500-$25,000/year)
- **Too complex** (SmartRecruiters: weeks of onboarding)
- **Too limited** (BambooHR: basic ATS as an afterthought)

**Hi-Ring bridges this gap**: enterprise features at startup speed and SMB pricing.
